# DNA Triangulation Calculator

A sophisticated web application for analyzing DNA segment data to identify triangulated groups of genetic matches. This tool helps genealogists confirm shared ancestry by finding overlapping DNA segments between multiple matches.

## üß¨ What is DNA Triangulation?

DNA triangulation is a genealogical technique that confirms shared ancestry by identifying overlapping DNA segments between three or more people. When multiple DNA matches share the same segment on the same chromosome, it strongly suggests they inherited that DNA from a common ancestor.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-file CSV Processing**: Upload and process multiple chromosome browser CSV files
- **Intelligent Header Detection**: Automatically detects and maps CSV headers from various DNA testing companies
- **Advanced Name Deduplication**: Smart matching and merging of duplicate entries across files
- **Flexible Data Parsing**: Handles various CSV formats and data structures

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Triangulation Detection**: Identifies overlapping DNA segments between multiple matches
- **Relationship Prediction**: Estimates relationships based on shared DNA amounts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates reliability scores for triangulation groups
- **Chromosome Browser**: Visual representation of triangulated segments across chromosomes

### Enhanced Features
- **GEDCOM Integration**: Cross-reference with family tree data for enhanced analysis
- **Genealogical Tree Matching**: Identify potential common ancestors
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter results by chromosome, size, confidence, and more
- **Research Annotations**: Add notes, surnames, locations, and tags to groups
- **Export Functionality**: Download results as CSV for further analysis

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** for build tooling

### Key Components
- `TriangulationCalculator`: Main application component
- `FileUpload`: Handles CSV file processing
- `TriangulationResults`: Displays analysis results
- `ChromosomeBrowser`: Visual chromosome representation
- `FilterAndAnnotation`: Advanced filtering and research tools

### Core Algorithms
- **CSV Parser**: Intelligent header detection and data mapping
- **Triangulation Engine**: Overlap detection and group formation
- **Relationship Predictor**: Statistical relationship estimation
- **Name Deduplication**: Smart matching across multiple files

## üìä Analysis Methodology

### Triangulation Detection
1. **Segment Grouping**: Group DNA segments by chromosome
2. **Overlap Calculation**: Identify overlapping regions between matches
3. **Threshold Application**: Apply minimum size and overlap requirements
4. **Group Formation**: Create triangulation groups with sufficient matches

### Confidence Scoring
Confidence scores are calculated based on:
- Average segment size (larger = higher confidence)
- Overlap percentage (higher = more reliable)
- Number of matches (more = better triangulation)
- Total shared DNA amount

### Relationship Prediction
Uses statistical data from the Shared cM Project to estimate relationships:
- Parent/Child: 3400-3720 cM
- Full Sibling: 2200-3400 cM
- 1st Cousin: 550-1300 cM
- 2nd Cousin: 200-600 cM
- And more distant relationships...
